$-- represents a normal user
sudo su is the command to become root user
# -- in linux represents root user
pwd -- present working directory
/home/ec2-user-- is the home directory
uname -- it will give kernal name
so in linux command syntax is <coomand> <options> <inputs>, here options and commands are octionally optional

man --> means manual 
<coomand name> --help it will give you the information about the command.
history --> this will give you all the commands used in a session.

ls -- List of subdirectories

By default we will launch at /home/ec2-user home folder.

cd --> change directory
/ --> root directory
cd / --> it will take you to the home directory

ls -l --> it means lenghty format in alphabetical order
ls -lr --> lenghty format i  reverse order from z-a
ls -lt --> latest file on the top-- t for timing
ls -ltr --> oldest file is on the top
ls -la --> List all files and folders including hidden.

- ---> means file
cd .. --> this will take you one step back

CRUD
----
C-- Create, R-- Read, U-- Update, D-- Delate

File creation in Linux:-
touch --> creates an empty file
example:- touch <file name>, touch linux basics

Directory creation in linux:- command is mkdir dir stands for directory, syntax is mkdir <directory name>, example mkdir LINUX, it will create a empty directory called LINUX

Update a file with content:- cat > <file name>, a cursor will appears and you can enter the text in the file, press control d to save the file.
Read a file:- cat <filename>, will display,
cat > <file name> if you enter the content, in an existed file, it will override the previous content.
> one greater than symbol will replaces the content
>> will append the content, means it will add the content to the existed content.

REMOVE FILE and FOLDER/DIRECTORY:-
rm <file name>
rmdir <folder-name> --> removes empty directory.
rm -r <folder-name> --> removes the directory including files. -r stands for recorsive, it means go inside folder and delete everything.

COPY:-
-------
cp <source> <destination>
cp -r --> copy reccursively

CUT:-
----
here mv move is used to perform cut operations in linux
mv <source> <destination>
mv <file name> <file name-1> example mv linux linux-1, if you are trying to move a file in the same destination, with a different name it will rename the existed file.

SEARCH:-
cp /etc/paswwd passwd
synatax:- grep <word-to-find> <file name>, command:- grep bin passwd
cat >> DevOps passwd
cat >> devops passwd
Note:- Linux is case senstive by default, if you enter same word with different format, it will consider as two different words for exampel DevOps and devops 
grep -i devops passwd, -i it will make case insestive
grep bin /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin

Piping concept in linux:- Pipe one output will be work as pipe two input, pipe two output will work as input to pipe three.
cat passwd | grep -i devops
hi learning devops
|--> one command output will become input to another command.

WGET VS CURL
------------
wget:- get from web 
wget https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe
wget command is used to download the file
curl :- downloads the text content directly on to the terminal

CUT and AWK
these are importnat will use heavly in scripting,
for example consider the following URL https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe
Delimeter:- if i choose the delimiter point as : then i will get two delimeters before : and after :. We will get fragments when we do delimeter.
syntax:- cut -d / -f1
-d indicates delimeter
/ delimeter point, these can chnages it might be : . -
-f1 fragment one
echo https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe | cut -d / -f1
https:
echo https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe | cut -d :  -f2
//github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe
cut:- we will use cut command to divide into fragments based upon perticular delimiter, so it is our wish to select which one as a delimet.

Using AWK:- 
Input:-echo https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe | awk -F / '{print $1F}'
Output:- https:

Input:- echo https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.45.2.windows.1/Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe | awk -F / '{print $NF}' --- here we gave $NF so the output is last fragment.
Output:- Git-2.45.2-64-bit.exe
